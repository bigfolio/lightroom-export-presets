BIG Folio Lightroom Export Presets
========================

These presets allow you to quickly export images for use in your BIG Folio website. Once installed, you can export images directly from Lightroom for your specific design. 

Installation
------------------------

Clone or download the files. Then, rename the folder to something pleasant such as "BIG Folio Export Presets". You must them place the folder in your Lightroom Export Presets folder. On Mac OS X, this is located in:

*[HOME FOLDER]/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Lightroom/Export Presets*

Simply copy the folder containing your presets into this folder. Make sure not to copy them to the Library folder at the root of your drive.

**Note for OS X Lion users**: The Library folder is hidden in Finder on OS X Lion. To navigate to the folder, open a Finder window then click  the "Go" menu. Select "Go to Folder" and enter "~/Library". From there, navigate to the folder specified above.

Usage
------------------------

From Lightroom, simply select the images you wish to use in your site and click the Export button. 

On the left-hand column of the export window, you should see your presets in a folder. Select the gallery preset that corresponds to your site's design. Click the Export button and the select images will be resized and placed in a folder on your Desktop. 

For page images, images are renamed with "Page-Image-NNNN" where NNNN is the file number of the original file.
